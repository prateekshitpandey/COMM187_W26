Like box plots, they show median, quartiles, and range. **The key addition is the width of the violin at any point represents how common that value is in the data - wider sections mean more data points at that value.** This reveals the full distribution shape, showing whether data is bimodal (two peaks), skewed, or has other patterns that box plots hide. Particularly useful when comparing distributions across multiple groups side-by-side.\n",
